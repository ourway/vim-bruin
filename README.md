## Status

WIP. Use at your own risk.

## Design goals

* should use colors *only* for UI-related highlight groups
* should *only* use combinations of **b**old, **r**everse, **u**nderline, **i**talic, and **N**ONE for syntax-related highlight groups
* should work the same on *light* and *dark* background without human intervention
